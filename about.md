I am a software developer from Portland Oregon with strong full-stack web-development skills. Outside of work I am primarily interested in programming languages and paradigms, mathematics, and pretty much any branch of theoretical computer science.

Check out my [Github](https://github.com/evanhackett) to view some of my projects. If you wish to contact me, the best way is to send me an [email](mailto:evanwhackett@gmail.com).
