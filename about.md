I am a software developer from Portland Oregon with strong full-stack web-development skills. I also teach programming to elementary school kids and tutor college students in computer science. Outside of work I am primarily interested in programming languages and paradigms.

Check out my [portfolio](http://evanhackett.com/portfolio/) and my [Github](https://github.com/evanhackett) to view some of my projects. If you wish to contact me, the best way is to send me an [email](mailto:evanwhackett@gmail.com).
